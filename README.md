# Virtual Cash on Delivery

This app was developed as a working prototype for the product RupeeSafe in May 2014. This was my summer intership project. It uses Spring Core, Spring Security and Spring Batch. The project uses Hibernate as the ORM and ehcache for caching purposes. For the email jobs to work fill in the sendgrid configuration details in `spring.properties`
